#ASDP API Sampler for iOS

This app provides sample API function calls for ASDP APIs. You are more than welcome to use the code here for making API calls. The most helpful methods for API use can be found in the `ASDP Sampler/Network` subdirectory. 

- `ASDPRequestManager` includes calls for all APIs that are supported by the emulator
- Each API call will return an `ASDPResult` object with success/error status & response data in a completion block on the main thread
